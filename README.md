Creative Portion:
We included a like system for the stories and comments. Registered users can 'like' and 'unlike' posts and a total is displayed on each respective story or comment. We also created a system for guests to be able to view the forum. They cannot interact with the forum outside of viewing (i.e., no liking, commenting, posting, etc.), and they can just login using a button. Guest users can also view how many likes a post has but cannot like posts themselves. Also, comments are sorted and ordered by number of likes.

TA can create their own account but here is a sample working login:
user: SampleUser
pass: SamplePass
